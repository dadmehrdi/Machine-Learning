### Thesis Work
Files with names starting with "thesis" contain the R code for my Ph.D. thesis in Economics. 

This code aims to answer critical questions in the Industrial Organization and Applied Microeconomics field. It utilizes a variety of econometric techniques to analyze data and generate insights. If you would like more context on the research questions and methodologies, please take a look at the Working Papers section in my resume.


### Machine Learning Project
Files with names that start with "ML" are part of a machine learning course project.

ML3-A6 aims to implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while maintaining as much variability in the data as possible.


ML4-A5 aims to build and evaluate different deep learning architectures, including logistic regression, single-layer, and convolutional neural networks, for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It also involves hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models, targeting at least 70% accuracy on a validation set.
