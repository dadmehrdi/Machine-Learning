## Repository Contents

### Thesis Work
Files with names starting with "thesis" contain the R code for my Ph.D. thesis in Economics. 

This code aims to answer critical questions in the Industrial Organization and Applied Microeconomics field. It utilizes a variety of econometric techniques to analyze data and generate insights. If you want more context on the research questions and methodologies, please look at the Working Papers section in my resume.

### Machine Learning Projects
Files with names starting with "ML" are part of a machine learning course project.

"ML3-A6" aims to implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while maintaining as much variability in the data as possible.

"ML4-A5" aims to build and evaluate different deep learning architectures, including logistic regression, single-layer, and convolutional neural networks, for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It also involves hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models, targeting at least 70% accuracy on a validation set.

"ML5-A3" aims to implement Kernel Ridge Regression on a synthetic dataset to predict a function. The project involves hyperparameter optimization via cross-validation and leverages non-parametric bootstrap techniques to construct confidence intervals for the predicted outcomes.

### Capital_Management
"XYZ_Capital_Management" aims to implement different techniques, including deep neural network and regression, to forecast y using x_1 to x_5 - the 1st part of the code aims to bring empirical evidence for some theoretical questions.


###  Web Scraping
"AEA_Scraping" aims to extract and visualize the frequency of the top 10 non-academic positions from the 2022 JOE listings on the AEA website using web scraping techniques.
